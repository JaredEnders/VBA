# VBA
# Part 1:
- Dynamically updated the headers and extracted words before the phrase "_Wells_Fargo" to figure out the state in the chart.
- Then, added the state to the first column of each spreadsheet.
- Converted the headers of each row to simply say the year.
- Converted the numbers to currency values for all cells.

# Part 2:
- Combined all the previous Excel sheets into one massive table on a new sheet...
    - Looped through every worksheet and selected the state contents
    - Copied the state contents and pasted it into the 'Combined_Data' tab
